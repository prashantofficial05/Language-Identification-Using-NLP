# Language-Identification-Using-NLP

**Introduction:** 

   This project builds a language identification model using a multilingual dataset. The objective is to 
   classify the language of a given text input accurately. The project involves exploratory data analysis 
   (EDA), text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a logistic regression model to 
   identify languages efficiently.

**Goal:**
    To analyze multilingual text data, identify patterns, and build a machine-learning model that 
    accurately predicts the language of each text input.

**Description:**
  The project utilizes multilingual text data to:

  - **Clean and Preprocess Text Data:** Remove punctuation, and special characters, and convert text to 
       lowercase.
  - **Extract Features:** Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
  - **Build Language Classification Model:** Train a logistic regression model for language identification.
  - **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess the model using metrics like accuracy and classification 
      reports.

     
**Skills:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Python Python (Pandas, NumPy, sci-kit-learn)
  - **Text Processing:** Regular Expressions (re) for cleaning text data
  - **Modeling Tools:** Logistic Regression for classification

**Metrics:**
  - **Model Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified language samples in the test set.
  - **Classification Report:** Detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each 
     language.
 

**Summary:**
   The analysis demonstrated the model's ability to accurately identify the language of text inputs, 
   revealing insights into patterns in multilingual data. The logistic regression model provided good 
   accuracy and was effective in distinguishing between multiple languages.

**Next Steps:**
  - **Improve Model Accuracy:** Experiment with more advanced models like SVM, Random Forest, or Neural 
        Networks for better performance.
  - **Expand the Dataset:** Incorporate additional languages and larger datasets for broader language 
        coverage.
  - **Deploy the Model:** Create a web application using Flask for real-time language identification.
  - **Experiment with Deep Learning:** Test models such as LSTM or BERT for advanced language detection 
     capabilities.
